#Giphy API Search  
##Lauren Libretti
I generated a giph search using Jquery. Page is styled via bootstrap.
There is a nav bar at the top of the page that shifts to a hamburger menu on smaller screens. There is a searchbar using Jquery with an API call to search and populate results.

###Ideas for Improvement
-I'd like to use sass for styling.
-giphs that are displayed in margins before searching.
-Add a hover effect on the search button with an icon.

###User Stories
-As a {person who likes jokes} want to search for images so that {I can get a chuckle}.
-As a {person wanting imagery} I want to be able to search for images that I can {filter to a topic}.
